Route 25 will define the future of mobility by “positioning Portugal at the forefront of intelligent and inclusive transportation technologies”. This project leverages the research and development of disruptive technological solutions for Autonomous, Intelligent, Interoperable and Inclusive Mobility, creating a new value chain in Portugal in technology-intensive activities and territorial cohesion, generating EUR 80M in sales and 488 jobs. Route 25 is based on areas of intervention that will result in the placing on the market of 47 innovative and disruptive PPS related to assisted and autonomous driving for safe mobility, a digital experience for cooperative mobility, connected infrastructures for resilient and inclusive cities and smart infrastructures for low-carbon intercity mobility – it is the only Agenda to address these areas and has the necessary PPS, dependent and interconnected, to achieve the defined objectives.

## Main objective

Route 25 builds and expands on very mature and well tested technologies with high TRL to address the aforementioned market needs. The total addressable market are all companies that build their businesses on connected cars, buses, trucks, autonomous vehicles telematics units, dash-cams, handhelds, drones, robots, industrial machines and other moving things. The products and services accelerated by Route 25 enable these prospective customers and their end customers to transfer 10x more and better quality data intelligently to/from the cloud, while setting the stage for a plethora of new local interactions among devices and their users. Knowing that all networking aspects are taken care of intelligently with a simple subscription based on devices, data and/or interactions, those companies can focus on what they do best: train their extensive AI algorithms better, use better information to run their operations, and invent new products, services and businesses that delight their customers. Within the infrastructure space, network operators will also benefit from Route 25, because they can now offer a wide range of communication services tailored to IoT players that utilise their various network assets in the most efficient and profitable way. In particular, they can finally achieve close-to-perfect load balancing across networks, times and locations, providing the best-connected experience to both people and things. Route 25 further leads to an overall ecosystem growth with network effects powered by intelligent networking in a much more sustainable and equitable way. End customers thrive, from mobility service providers to industries of all kinds. And ultimately, the planet is more sustainable due to much more energy efficient mobility systems and infrastructures, and millions of people are able to lead happier and healthier lives. 

As such, Route 25 will seek to answer some important questions: How can Portugal adapt to stay relevant in the mobility industry? What is Portugal’s role in the European and global mobility? Where do we place Portugal’s mobility in the near future? Will Portugal’s industry be disrupted, or will it be part of the revolution?
