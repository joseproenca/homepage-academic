# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Luís Soares Barbosa is a professor in Computer Science at the Informatics Department, Universidade do Minho, and a senior researcher at the High Assurance Software laboratory, HASLab INESC TEC. He has complementary academic affiliations with INL (the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory), where he leads the Quantum Software Engineering Group since August 2019, and to the United Nations University, currently serving as Deputy Head of its Operational Unit on Policy-driven Electronic Governance. He is a member of IFIP WG1.3 (Foundations of System Specification), and chair of IFIP Technical Committee TC1, on Foundations of Computer science. His main research focuses on program semantics, logics and calculi applied to rigorous software analysis, design, and construction. He is particularly interested in the architectural dimension (interaction, composition, and reconfiguration) of different sorts of software components, namely non deterministic, probabilistic, continuous, or hybrid.

<p id="text" style="padding-top: 30px;"> 
I am full professor at the <a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt">Computer Science Department</a>, <a href="http://www.uminho.pt">Universidade do Minho</a>, and a senior researcher at the High Assurance Software laboratory, <a href="http://haslab.uminho.pt/">HASLab INESC TEC</a>.  
I am a member of <a href="http://ifipwg13.cs.ovgu.de/">IFIP WG1.3</a>  (Foundations of System Specification), and, since January 2019 chair of <a href="http://www.ifip-tc1.org/"> IFIP Technical Committee TC1</a>, on Foundations of Computer Science. Previously, from 2013 to 2018, I have served as Portugal representative in this Committee.

My main research focuses on program semantics, logics and calculi applied to  rigorous software analysis, design, and construction. I am particularly interested in the architectural dimension (interaction, composition, and reconfiguration) of different sorts of software components, namely nondeterministic, probabilistic, quantum, continuous, or hybrid. Most of my work is framed on Coalgebra and Modal Logic.

</p><p id="text">
More recently I became interested in exploring connections between Physics and Computation at two levels: the discrete-continuous frontier and the classic-quantum interaction. In this context, I've recently joined <a href="https://inl.int/"> INL</a>, the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, to lead the new <a href="https://inl.int/quantum-materials/quantum-software-engineering/"> Quantum Software Engineering Group</a>. I am also serving in the coordination teams of the <a href="https://www.uminho.pt/EN/education/educational-offer/_layouts/15/UMinho.PortalUM.UI/Pages/CatalogoCursoDetail.aspx?itemId=3553&amp;catId=10"> MSc on Physics Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.quantalab.org/">QuantaLab</a>, a collaborative research initiative on Quantum Materials and Quantum Technologies.

</p><p id="text">
I have a second academic affiliation to the <a href="https://unu.edu/">United Nations University</a>, currently serving as Deputy Head of its Operational Unit on Policy-driven Electronic Governance. <a href="https://egov.unu.edu/">UNU-EGOV</a> is an international think-tank devoted to 
multidisciplinary research on how digital transformation may contribute to empowered democratic citizenship, trustworthy public infrastructures, more inclusive societies and, in broad terms, to sustainable development.
</p><p id="text">
Above all, I am very fortunate to work with an amazing team of students and post-docs. Our joint research is framed in the <a href="http://arca.di.uminho.pt/">ARCA Software Architecture &amp; Design Calculi</a> group.
