# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Renato Neves is a Auxiliar Professor at University of Minho and a researcher at INESC TEC.
  His main focus are on (quantitative) syntax and semantics of programming languages, typically in the setting of cyber-physical and quantum computing.

# One of his main goals is the development of reasoning tools, syntax, and semantics for hybrid systems, a highly complex class of devices that intertwines different aspects of analysis, control theory, and computer science. Hybrid systems are a main ingredient in the 21st centuryâ€™s technology, but even so they are still remarkably difficult to design and analyse in a systematic and disciplined way. His collaborators and him have been tackling this challenge by applying and advancing different mathematical frameworks. In particular, monad-based programming, automata theory, coalgebra, modal and dynamic logic, and category theory.

My overarching focus is on the development of reasoning tools, syntax, and semantics for cyber-physical systems, a highly interesting class of devices that intertwines different aspects of analysis, control theory, and computer science. Cyber-physical systems are a main ingredient in the 21st century's technology, but even so they are still remarkably difficult to design and analyse in a systematic and disciplined way.
