## 9th ACM International Workshop on Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems

There is an increasing demand for using formal methods to validate and verify safety-critical systems in fields such as power generation and distribution, avionics, automotive systems, medical systems, and autonomous vehicles. In particular, newer standards, such as DO-178C (avionics), ISO 26262 (automotive systems), IEC 62304 (medical devices), and CENELEC EN 50128 (railway systems), emphasize the need for formal methods and model-based development, thereby speeding up the adaptation of such methods in industry.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and engineers who are interested in the application of formal and semi-formal methods to improve the quality of safety-critical computer systems. FTSCS strives to promote research and development of formal methods and tools for industrial applications, and is particularly interested in industrial applications of formal methods.

Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

  - case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods for analyzing safety-critical systems, including avionics, automotive, medical, railway, and other kinds of safety-critical and QoS-critical systems
  - methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis, certification, debugging, etc., of safety/QoS-critical systems
  - analysis methods that address the limitations of formal methods in industry (usability, scalability, etc.)
  - formal analysis support for modeling languages used in industry, such as AADL, Ptolemy, SysML, SCADE, Modelica, etc.
  - code generation from validated models.

The workshop will provide a platform for discussions and the exchange of innovative ideas, so submissions on work in progress are encouraged.
