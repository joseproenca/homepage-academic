FACS 2022 is concerned with how formal methods can be applied to component-based software and system development. Formal methods have provided foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and certification.

This edition will be help online in November 2022, hosted by Oslo University, and already counts with a great line up of invited speakers and a strong program committee.
