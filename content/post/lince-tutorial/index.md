Lince provides a set of online tools to simulate and analyse hybrid programs, which are simple c-like programs where some variables can sometimes evolve according to a system of differential equations. You can experiment with it in http://arcatools.org/lince, or you can [download](https://github.com/arcalab/lince) it and run it locally.

This talk provides an overview of how to use Lince, and lists possible challenges that could be pursued by BSc or MSc students.

The slides are available [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Preif0pc99FxSlXRImtWv1SHTSXKwG150pDVy9bOWpU/edit?usp=sharing).
