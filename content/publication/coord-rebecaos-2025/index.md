## Abstract

We describe RebeCaos, a user-friendly web-based front-end tool for the Rebeca language, based on the Caos library for Scala. RebeCaos can simulate dierent operational semantics of (timed) Rebeca, thus
facilitating the dissemination and awareness of Rebeca, providing insights
into the dierences among existing semantics for Rebeca, and supporting
quick experimentation of new Rebeca variants (e.g., when the order of
received messages is preserved). The tool also comes with initial reachability analyses for Rebeca models (e.g., the possibility of reaching deadlocks or desirable states). We illustrate the RebeCaos tool by means of a
ticket service use case from the timed Rebeca literature.
