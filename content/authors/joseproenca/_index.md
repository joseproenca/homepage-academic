I am currently a postdoc at [CISTER](https://cister-labs.pt), [ISEP](https://isep.ipp.pt), Portugal, working on formal models for component-based systems. Until January 2019 I worked in [HASLab](https://haslab.pt), [INESC TEC](https://inesctec.pt) & [University of Minho](http://di.uminho.pt), working with [Luís Barbosa](http://di.uminho.pt/~lsb), and was affiliated with [Distrinet](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/), [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/), until January 2016, working mainly with [Danny Hughes](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/dannyh) and [Dave Clarke](http://supercooldave.github.io). My work has been mainly on coordination of distributed components, often associated to the [Reo](http://reo.project.cwi.nl/) coordination language, and on formal approaches to software product line engineering. More recently I have been working on component models for embedded devices in the context of the [LooCI](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/looci) middleware and micro PnP (now part of [VersaSense](https://www.versasense.com/)), and in the context of the [VirtuosoNext RTOS](http://www.altreonic.com/content/product-overview).

Before I graduated in University of Minho, Portugal, for a 5 year degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. I studied abroad for 6 months as an Erasmus student in Bristol University, UK. I defended my PhD in [Leiden University](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/) in May 2011, for my work carried in [CWI](http://www.cwi.nl/), Amsterdam, in the group for [Foundations of Software Engineering](http://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/Foundations-of-software-engineering).
