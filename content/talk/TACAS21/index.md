## 27th International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems

TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in rigorously based tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems. The conference aims to bridge the gaps between different communities with this common interest and to support them in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools and algorithms for building systems.

Theoretical papers with clear relevance for tool construction and analysis as well as tool descriptions and case studies with a conceptual message are all encouraged. The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to:

- specification and verification techniques;
- software and hardware verification;
- analytical techniques for real-time, hybrid, or stochastic systems;
- analytical techniques for safety, security, or dependability;
- SAT and SMT solving;
- theorem proving;
- model checking;
- static and dynamic program analysis;
- testing;
- abstraction techniques for modeling and verification;
- compositional and refinement-based methodologies;
- system construction and transformation techniques;
- machine-learning techniques for synthesis and verification;
- tool environments and tool architectures;
- applications and case studies.
