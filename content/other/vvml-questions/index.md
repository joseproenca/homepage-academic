All diagrams were generated with mermaid-js -- <https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor>.

The goal of this questions is not to bring issues or alternative designs, but to clarify and make choices over the design (even if not optimal ones), most likely following the conventions guided by Enterprise Architect.

## Loops with temporary artefacts

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Method
    Init(( )):::in --> W1([A1])
    W1 --> W2([A2])
    W1 -.-> T1[ ]:::tr
    T1 -.-> W2
    W2 --> more{more?}:::gw
    more --yes--> W1
    more --no--> Stop(( )):::st
  end
  T1 -....-> out:::it
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
classDef it fill:#f88,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#822;
```

<!-- 
```plantuml
@startuml
partition Activity {
   (*) --~> A1
    A1 --~> A2
    A1 --~> === T1 ===
       ..> A2
    if "more?" then
      --~>[yes] A1
    else
      --~>[no] (*) 
    endif
}
=== T1 === ..> out
@enduml
```
-->

The question raised here (by Ruppert) was if there is a compact way of only sending the last artefact to `out` when the loop is exited. For example, a variation of the diagram below.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Method
    Init(( )):::in --> W1([A1])
    W1 --> W2([A2])
    W1 -.-> T1[ ]:::tr
    T1 -.-> W2
    W2 --> more{more?}:::gw
    more --yes--> W1
    more --no--> T2[ ]:::tr
    T2 --> Stop(( )):::st
    T1 -.-> T2
  end
  T2 -..-> out:::it
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
classDef it fill:#f88,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#822;
```

Another variation example below.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Method
    Init(( )):::in --> W1([A1])
    W1 --> W2([A2])
    W1 -.-> T1[ ]:::tr
    T1 -.-> W2
    W2 --> more{more?}:::gw
    more --yes--> W1
    more --no--> T2[ ]:::tr
    T2 --> Stop(( )):::st & buffer
    T1 -.-> buffer
  end
  buffer -.-> out:::it
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
classDef it fill:#f88,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#822;
```

__Conclusions:__
A new `sync bar` is planned to be introduced, mixing sequence- and artefact-flows, whereas all input sequences and artefacts must be present for the `bar` to be active.
If 3 artefacts are produced by A1 in the loop, only 1 artefact should go to `out`.
I guess this should not specify how artefacts are collected by the last `fork` while waiting for it to become active.
(More on the `sync bar` further below.)

__Pierluigi:__
Expose method artefacts only after the method ends. Until there, artefacts can be updated. Hence 1st version is better.
Also, drop fork of artefacts, ending up with version 4 below.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Method
    Init(( )):::in --> W1([A1])
    W1 --> W2([A2])
    W1 -.-> W2
    W2 --> more{more?}:::gw
    more --yes--> W1
    more --no--> Stop(( )):::st
  end
  W1 -....-> out:::it
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
classDef it fill:#f88,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#822;
```


## Dependency vs. instantiating

Below, can if A1 is done 5 times, does A3 also has to be done 3 times?
Can A3 be done 3 times?

```mermaid
graph LR
    Init(( )):::in --> W1([A1])
    W2([A2])
    W1 --> T1[ ]:::tr
    T1 --> W2 & W3([A3])
    W2 --> more{more?}:::gw
    more --yes--> W1
    more --no--> T2[ ]:::tr
    W3 --> T2
    T2 --> Stop(( )):::st
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
classDef it fill:#f88,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#822;
```

__Conclusions:__
It is ambiguous on whether `A3` should be executed multiple times or one time.
This is therefore a ill-designed flow, and should be avoided. (Pierluigi agrees this is an illegal model.)

## Multiplicity

Is any of the following allowed?

```mermaid
graph TD
    W1([A1]) --> W2([A2])
    W1 --> W3([A3])
    W4([A1]) --> W6([A3])
    W5([A2]) --> W6
    W1b([A1: 1 output]) -.-> W2b([A2])
    W1b -.-> W3b([A3])
    W4b([A1]) -.-> W6b([A3: 1 input])
    W5b([A2]) -.-> W6b
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    Init(( )):::in --> Tr0[ ]:::tr
    Tr0 --> W1a([A1]) & W2a([A2])

    W1c([A1]) --> T1[ ]:::tr
    W2c([A2]) --> T1
    T1 --> St(( )):::st

    T2[ ]:::tr --> W1d([A1]) & W2d([A2])
    W1d --> St1(( )):::st
    W2d --> St2(( )):::st

    W1e([A1]) & W2e([A2]) --> merge{ }:::gw
    merge --> W3e([A3])

    Init2(( )):::in --> W4([A1])
    W5([A2]) --> St5(( )):::st
    W4 -.- W5
    linkStyle 15 stroke:white;
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```

__Conclusions:__
(1) and (3) are not ok - a `fork` or `gateway` should be used in both cases.
(2) and (4) are ok, and semantically equivalent to the use of a `gateway` (in case this becomes valid syntax).
(5) annd (6) are not supported yet but ok; (5) is equivalent to have 2 start nodes, one for each activity.
(7) is a bit strange but ok (would be better with a `gateway` instead of `fork`.)
(8) is not supported yet, but ok (and equivalent to (2)).
(9) is not valid, since all activities must have an incoming (sequence) arrow (__Suggestion:__ syntactic sugar - no incoming arrow is interpreted as an arrow from the start node).

__Pierluigi:__
Some contradicting opinions:

 - 1 and 2 need a fork/join; avoid implicit representations (current examples use (2))
 - 3 is OK, having 2 arrows from an "output pin" (currently a fork is used, but should not)
 - 4 is wrong: "it means that A1 and A2 provide the same output data, if this is the intention, a data store is required but without a right control flow that sinchronize A1 and A2 execution, thus the data update sequence, the data value is undefined." (I (JosÃ©) do not see a clear problem of A3 using the last available artefact.)
 - 7 is wrong (only 1 end point is allowed, or at most something equivalent to use 1 end point)
 - 8 is correct (and should be used instead of (2))
 - 9 is ilogic: it means A2 will never run.


## Overriding method output artefacts

Will both the artefact from A1 and A2 below go to Out?

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Method
    W1([A1]); W2([A2]);  W3([A3]); 
    T1[ ]:::tr; T2[ ]:::tr;
    Init(( )):::in --> W1
    W1 -.->T1
    T1 -.-> W2
    W2 -.->T2
    T2 -.-> W3
    W1 --> W2; W2 --> W3;
    W3 --> Stop(( )):::st
  end
  T1 & T2 -.-> out:::it
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
classDef it fill:#f88,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#822;
```

__Conclusions:__
This is a source of long unproductive discussions.
This seems ok, and desirable if A1 and A2 produce the same kind of artefacts, better supporting a modular development. I.e., allowing this method to be replaced by an equivalent one that uses different activities.
In many cases we want to distinguish the output of A1 and A2, where we should produce 2 different outputs.

A similar discussion is on whether internal artefacts are allowed or if all should be made public. I prefer the former (more modular).

__Pierluigi:__
Output artifact `out` is only made available after the method ends. Hence the artefact from A1 to A2 is never exposed and unnecessary.

## Small DSL metamodel comments

Some doubts of possible imprecisions in the DSL metamodel (Fig. 8 in the [handbook](https://risecloud.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/VALU3S-general/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BBD04EF21-B815-49FE-8C5C-724089C0CAD7%7D&file=V%26VML_Handbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)).

 - A `method` does not seem to be able to own a reference to another `method`. In the examples there is a special `activity` that can `call/invoke` another `method`. This seems to be missing from the metamodel. Also, it is not clear if these calls can be recursive - I'm guessing that they should not, and have only explicit loops as a mechanism for repetition.
 - A `gateway` cannot be connected to another `gateway`, but I recall examples where this was the case. Should it be?
 - A `gateway` cannot be connected to a `ForkNode` (and vice-versa), but an example allows this (Fig. 9, where sequence arrows are also mistakenly used).
 - Maybe the multiplicity of ArtefactFlow and SequenceFlow could be included? (I'm not sure this is valid UML). For example, to clarify how many inputs/outputs can `gateways` have. Maybe clarifying some of my "Multiplicity" questions above.
 - A `ForkNode` cannot be connected to another `ForkNode`, but the examples suggest it can. Should it be?
 - The DSL suggests that a single `ForkNode` can have any combination of `SequenceFlows` and `ArtifactFlows` going in and out. Maybe having different forks for Sequence and for Artifacts could provide more refined syntactic restrictions.


## Sync bar

There was a discussion to __generalise Fork/Joins__ to so-called __sync bars__ to allow a combination of many `ArtifactFlows` and `SequenceFlows`  both as input and output. Traditional `ForkNode` were meant to have 2 inputs and 1 output or vice-versa, and without mixing `ArtifactFlows` and `SequenceFlows`.
Sync bars should replace the traditional `ForkNodes`, since they do not break their semantics.

__Pierluigi:__
Sync bars are confusing and should NOT be used. Mixing both flows "increases complexity and decreases comprehension".


### Interpretation 1: merge and replicate
My interpretation of sync bars below.

```mermaid
graph TD
    W1[1]:::emp; W2([2]):::emp;  W3([3]):::emp;
    W4[4]:::emp; W5([5]):::emp;  W6([6]):::emp; 
    W7[7]:::emp; W8([8]):::emp;
    T1[ ]:::tr;
    W1 & W2 -->  T1
    W3 & W4 -.-> T1
    T1 --> W5 & W6
    T1 -.-> W7 & W8
classDef tr fill:#a66,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef emp fill:#0000,stroke-width:0pt;
```

In the example above the __sync bar__ will only be _active_ when `1` and `2` are triggered, triggering `5` and `6`. Once it is _active_, any artifact from `3` or `4` sent to the bar is replicated to both `8` and `9`.


### Interpretation 2: associate inputs to outputs
Another interpretation, suggested by Herzner, is to use the names of artifacts to associate incoming arrows to output arrows with the same name.
The picture below illustrates this.

```mermaid
graph TD
    W1[1]:::emp;
    W2([art-1]):::empb;  W3([art-1]):::empb; W4[art-2]:::empr;
    W5([5]):::emp;
    W6([art-1]):::empb; W7[art-2]:::empr; W8([art-2]):::empr;
    T1[ ]:::tr;
    W1  -->  T1
    W2 & W3 & W4 -.-> T1
    T1 --> W5
    T1 -.-> W6 & W7 & W8
classDef tr fill:#a66,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef emp fill:#0000,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef empb fill:#0000,stroke-width:0pt,color:#33f;
classDef empr fill:#0000,stroke-width:0pt,color:#f33;
```

In this example there are 2 artifact names: `art-1` and `art-2`. After `1` fires the bar becomes active. Then:

 - both incoming artifacts named `art-1` are forwarded to the outgoing artifact `art-1`, 
 - the incoming artifact `art-2` is replicated to both outgoing artifacts named `art-2`.

The merging behaviour of `art-1` is still not clear: it could either (1) send any of the incoming artifacts to the outgoing ones, or (2) it could aggregate/combine the incoming artifacts before sending them. Option (2) would require all incoming artifacts to be present before sending an artifact, and option (1) would only require 1. I believe that option (1) is more natural, but this could anyway lead to confusions.


## Inspiration in PlantUML's syntax?

When browsing through PlantUML's new syntax for Activity Diagrams, I saw some restrictions in the syntax. E.g., loops can only be built via specific constructs (so no mutual recursion is possible).

- <https://plantuml.com/activity-diagram-beta>

They also use a hexagon for "activity + choice", as suggestion in a meeting for syntactic sugar, which supports the adoption of this syntax.


## Valid traces

```mermaid
graph LR
    W1([A1]) -.-> W2([A2])
    W2 -..- C[Can A2 start before A1 stops? And before A1 starts?]
    W2 -..- D[Valid trace?: A1.start, A2.start, A1.stop, S2.stop]
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```

__Conclusions:__
Invalid flow, because all activities must have an entry point.

```mermaid
graph LR
    W1([A1]); W2([A2]);  W3([A3]); 
    T1[ ]:::tr;
    Init(( )):::in --> W1;
    W1-->T1; T1-->W2; T1-->W3
    W2-->St(( )):::st;
    St -..- C[Can A3 be doing things after the diagram stop?]
    St -..- C2[Valid trace? Init, A1.start, A1.stop, A2.start, A2.stop, Stop]
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```

__Guess:__
A3 will be stopped or ignored once the method stops. If A3 produces artefacts, these will be ignored after stopping.

__Pierluigi:__
This example does not make sense because __only 1 end point can exist__, and because __all activities must be able to reach an end point__ (I'm inferring this property).

Forks do not seem to be able to connect to each other yet, but I guess they could and will.

<!-- When mixing sequence- and artefact-flows it could get more complicated, e.g., assuming an artefact could -->


## Mandatory artefacts

The interplay between artefacts and sequence flow seems something relatively new. It would be good to have this interplay precise in a useful way.
In the example below, assume that A3 is able to execute with and without the artefact from A2.

```mermaid
graph LR
    W1([A1]); W2([A2]); W3([A3]);
    T[ ]:::tr;
    Init(( )):::in --> W1
    W1 --> T
    T --> W2 & W3
    W2-.->W3;
    W3 -.- C[Can A3 start before A2? Note: the artefact may not be needed to start.]
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```

__Guess:__
It should be ok for A3 to start before A2 (artefacts should not be mandatory to start (or to finish)).


A refined scenario follows below, unfolding a possible A3.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph A3
    Init(( )):::in --> chose{?}:::gw
    chose --> W3a([A3a]) & W3b([A3b])
    W3a & W3b --> Stop(( )):::st
  end
  Init2(( )):::in --> W1([A1])
  W1 --> T[ ]:::tr
  T --> A3
  T --> W2([A2])
  W2 -.-> W3b
  W3a -..- C[Can A3a, and A3, start before A2?]
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```

If we want to observe `send` and `get` of artifacts:

```mermaid
graph LR
    W1([A1]) -.-> W2([A2])
    Init1(( )):::in --> W1 & W2
    W2 -.- C1[1. Can A2 start before A1 stops? guess: yes]
    W2 -.- C2[2. Can A2 start before A1 starts? guess: yes, with optional artifacts]
    W2 -.- C3[3. Valid trace?: A1.start, A2.start, A1.stop, S2.stop]
    W2 -.- C4[4. Invalid trace?: A1.start, A2.start, A1.art.send, A2.art.get, A2.art.get, ...]
classDef in fill:#2f2,stroke:#ccc;
classDef st fill:#000,stroke:#f22,stroke-width:4px;
classDef tr fill:#888,stroke-width:0pt;
classDef gw fill:#8f8,stroke-width:1pt,stroke:#000;
```


__Suggestion:__
Distinguish _optional_ from _mandatory_ (input) artifacts, using some new syntax for that, allowing flows to be also controlled by artifacts.

__Guess:__
As before, I think it should be ok for A3 (and A3a) to start before A2.

__Pierluigi:__
_"Similar comment as previous section. There is a concurrency problem to be represented correctly. I do not agree with the "suggestion": if an action has an input, it will take care on it. The input should be NULL (or EMPTY) but is there."_

## State & evolution of a workflow

The __state__  could be a tuple of:

 - Set of _active_ activities
 - (Set of _finished_ activities)
 - (Set of input artefacts available (relevant?))

An activity becomes __active__ when:

 - one of its dependencies _finishes_
 - it is a starting activity (in the beginning)

A __step__ of a workflow can be:
 
 - A.start
 - A.stop
 - A.art.write
 - A.art.read


__Pierluigi:__
Following the "activity diagrams approach":

 - Methods/activities have 3 states: _starting_, _running_, and _terminated_.
 - _Action tokens_ are placed over _start_, _end_, or _action_ nodes, defining the state.
 - A step/action is when the action token moves.
 - No need to include availabilty of artefacts in the state (at least is what I inferred).
