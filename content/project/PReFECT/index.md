title: PREfECT (07/2018-now)
summary:  "__Predictable Multiprocessor Platforms for Embedded Safety Critical Systems__ -  addresses the following challenges with respect to the introduction of multicore processors in safety-critical systems:
    
    - model and analyze the timing interference generated by the hardware resources shared between cores (e.g., caches, interconnect and I/O devices);

    - propose runtime mechanisms and scheduling solutions to mitigate the unpredictability of COTS multicore processors by controlling the interference between cores;

    - develop tools for the automatic system configuration before its deployment."
