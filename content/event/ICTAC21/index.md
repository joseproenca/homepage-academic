## 18th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing

The ICTAC conference series aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government to present research and exchange ideas and experience addressing challenges in both theoretical aspects of computing and the exploitation of theory through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to promote research cooperation between developing and industrial countries.

The conference concerns all aspect of theoretical computer science, including, but not limited to:

- Languages and automata
- Semantics of programming languages
- Logic in computer science
- Lambda calculus, type theory and category theory
- Domain-specific languages
- Theories of concurrency and mobility
- Theories of distributed computing
- Models of objects and components
- Coordination models
- Timed, hybrid, embedded and cyber-physical systems
- Security and privacy
- Static analysis
- Probabilistic and statistical verification
- Software verification
- Software testing
- Runtime verification
- Program generation and transformation
- Model checking and theorem proving
- Applications and case studies
