abstract: Hybrid programs combine classical program constructs with differential equations,
  and thus naturally appear in a wide range of application domains, from biology and
  control theory to software engineering. This ability to entangle discrete and continuous
  behaviour, however, yields aspects unusual to computer science and renders the formal
  design of hybrid programs a difficult task, not properly handled by the current
  programming theory and practices.
