## 20th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing

The International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC) was founded in 2004. It takes place every year preferably in a developing country. The aim of the colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and government to present research results, and exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals, another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in research and education between participants and their institutions, from developing and industrial countries.

The conference concerns all aspect of theoretical computer science, including, but not limited to:

 - Languages and automata
 - Semantics of programming languages
 - Logic in computer science
 - Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory
 - Domain-specific languages
 - Theories of concurrency and mobility
 - Theories of distributed computing
 - Models of objects and components
 - Coordination models
 - Timed, hybrid, embedded, and cyber-physical systems
 - Security and privacy
 - Static analysis
 - Software verification
 - Software testing
 - Program generation and transformation
 - Model checking and theorem proving
 - Theory and methods of trustworthy AI
 - Applications and experiences
